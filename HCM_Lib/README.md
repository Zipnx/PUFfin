# PUFfin Firmware

Heavy work in progress, this was put together to work, the code needs a cleanup, which
ill get to, when possible. Also, the HCM_CommandReceive has many gaps, well right now its
mostly gaps.

For use, the project needs to be added to the workspace. The BSP needs to be named hcmproj_bsp,
because i could find no other way to make the lib have access to the xil_io and xilinx uart/xsysmon 
header files.

TODO: Make a todo list here
